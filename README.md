## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Room not found**: Check that the room code is correct and the room exists
2. **Can't vote**: Ensure you haven't already voted for that suggestion
3. **Can't add suggestions**: Check if the room is locked
4. **Real-time not working**: Check your Supabase connection and RLS policies

### Debug Mode

Add `console.log` statements in the API routes to debug issues:
- Check browser network tab for API errors
- Check Supabase logs for database errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
